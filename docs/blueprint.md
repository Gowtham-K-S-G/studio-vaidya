- Primary color: Soft teal (#66D3CF) to convey trust, calm, and health. It's a modern take on traditional medical blues and greens without being sterile.
- Background color: Very light desaturated teal (#F0FAF9) for a clean, soothing backdrop that doesn't distract from the content.
- Accent color: Muted orange (#D38666) for key interactive elements, providing warmth and a clear visual distinction, contrasting with the teal.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for modern readability with approachability
- Use clear, minimalist icons that are easily understandable across different literacy levels.
- Clean and intuitive layout with a focus on voice-based navigation. Prioritize ease of use for elderly and semi-literate users.
- Subtle animations to guide the user through the app, providing feedback for voice commands and image uploads.
